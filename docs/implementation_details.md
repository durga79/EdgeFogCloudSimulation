## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the implementation of the Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture simulation based on the IEEE paper "Performance Analysis of Edge-Fog-Cloud Architectures in the Internet of Things" (2020/2021). The simulation demonstrates a three-tier architecture for processing IoT data with efficient distribution of computational tasks across edge devices, fog nodes, and cloud infrastructure.

## Paper Summary

The referenced paper presents a general performance model for communication architectures in IoT scenarios involving three processing layers: edge, fog, and cloud computing. The paper analyzes how data filtering and processing at each layer impacts overall system performance, particularly focusing on:

1. Latency reduction through edge processing
2. Bandwidth efficiency through hierarchical data flow
3. Energy consumption across different layers
4. Data reduction ratios at each processing tier
