## Project Report

### 1. Introduction to the Problem and Chosen Paper

#### 1.1 Problem Statement
The rapid expansion of IoT devices has led to unprecedented volumes of data being generated at the network edge. Traditional cloud-centric approaches face significant challenges in terms of latency, bandwidth consumption, and energy efficiency when processing this data. This project explores a hierarchical Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture to address these challenges.

**Title**: "Performance Analysis of Edge-Fog-Cloud Architectures in the Internet of Things"  
**Publication**: IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (2020/2021)  
**Authors**: [Authors of the paper]

#### 1.3 Paper's Core Contribution
The paper presents a comprehensive performance model for multi-tier IoT architectures, analyzing how distributing computational tasks across edge, fog, and cloud layers impacts system performance. The authors propose a framework for evaluating latency, bandwidth usage, and energy consumption in these hierarchical architectures.

### 2. System Design & Justification

#### 2.1 Paper's Proposed Architecture
The paper proposes a three-tier architecture:
- **IoT Layer**: Diverse devices generating heterogeneous data
- **Edge Layer**: Local processing nodes that filter and pre-process data
- **Fog Layer**: Intermediate nodes that aggregate and process data from multiple edge nodes
- **Cloud Layer**: Centralized infrastructure for complex analytics and long-term storage

The architecture enables data filtering at the edge, reducing the volume of data transmitted to higher layers. The fog layer further aggregates and processes data before forwarding to the cloud.

#### 2.2 Critical Analysis
The paper's architecture effectively addresses several key challenges in IoT environments:

**Big Data Perspective**:
- Handles the volume challenge through hierarchical data reduction
- Addresses velocity requirements through edge processing for time-sensitive data
- Manages variety by processing different data types appropriately at each layer

**Wireless/Mobile Technologies**:
- Considers constraints of wireless communication between IoT devices and edge nodes
- Accounts for varying bandwidth and latency characteristics across different network tiers

**Service Distribution**:
- Proposes a task allocation strategy based on computational requirements and time sensitivity
- Enables efficient resource utilization across the network

For this project, I have implemented a simplified simulation of the complete Edge-Fog-Cloud architecture focusing on:
1. Data generation at IoT devices with varying characteristics
2. Data filtering and processing at edge nodes
3. Data aggregation at fog nodes
4. Complex analytics at the cloud layer

This subset captures the essential aspects of the paper's architecture while remaining feasible for implementation.
